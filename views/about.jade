    | On December 23rd, 2014, our exchange student was opening her birthday present from her mom. It was a beautiful garland (for lack of another term) that would normally be strung across the doorway in the kitchen. Small gifts, cards and messages were hanging with various ribbon and bows. It was beautiful. "I have to make those!" My daughter suggests Etsy is the place for me. Wow!

    | By September, friends and colleagues took notice and invited me to take part in our school's "Milk and Cookies with Santa". So much fun! I sold and my name was out there. As of December 1st, 2015, my cards and tags will be at the "Les Activit√©s La-Di-D'Art" in Ste. Therese, Quebec.
